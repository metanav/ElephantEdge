This repository is for a project created at Hackster.io for the ElephantEdge contest. I have created a deep learning model using Edge Impulse Studio to detect elephant activity. For the training 3-axes accelerometer and 3-axes gyroscope data are used. The final model is deployed to the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and the inferencing result is displayed using mobile app over BLE connection.
